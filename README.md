# Fake_News_Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news from textual data. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of various classification algorithms to determine whether a news article is "fake" or "real."

## Project Overview
The Fake News Detection project follows these key steps:

### Data Preprocessing:
Removes noise, such as special characters and stopwords.
Performs text tokenization and lemmatization to normalize the text.

### Feature Extraction:
Transforms text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization.

### Model Training and Evaluation:
Implements machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Prediction:
Applies the trained model to classify unseen news articles.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning and normalization.

Feature Engineering: TF-IDF and other vectorization techniques.

Model Implementation: Multiple classification algorithms.

Evaluation: Comprehensive analysis of model performance.

## Results
The project evaluates various models and identifies the best-performing algorithm for detecting fake news. The results include performance metrics and visualizations for better insights.
