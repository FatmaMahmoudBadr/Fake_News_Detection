# Fake_News_Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news from textual data. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of various classification algorithms to determine whether a news article is "fake" or "real."

## Project Overview
The Fake News Detection project follows these key steps:

### Data Collection:

Utilizes a labeled dataset with articles marked as either "fake" or "real."

Data Preprocessing:

Removes noise, such as special characters and stopwords.

Performs text tokenization and lemmatization to normalize the text.

Feature Extraction:

Transforms text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Implements machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Prediction:

Applies the trained model to classify unseen news articles.
